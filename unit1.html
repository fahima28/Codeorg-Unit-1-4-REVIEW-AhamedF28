  <h1> Lesson #1 Welcome to CSP C.F.U</h1>
  <p><b>What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to the ones that you just heard about from other students?</b></p>
  <p>Jasmin says that she would doze off when she was tired and sleeping earlier helped her focus better in class. This is similar to me right now because I sleep pretty late, but slowly I'm starting to reach the 8 hours goal. Additionally, I agree with Sofia. When trying to remember something, I study and then I take a short break so I can test myself the next time I come back.</p>

  <h1> Lesson #2 Representing Information C.F.U</h1>
  <p><b>Recall when you built your information sending device. Why did we decide to send a message as a sequence of two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options?</b></p>
  <p>We decided to send a message as a sequence of two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options because it is more reliable and simple to use a sequence of two options. If you have more options, it leaves more room for error and requires the user to create more complex systems to implement it.</p>

  <h1> Lesson #3 Circle Square Patterns C.F.U</h1>
  <p><b>How would you explain a number system to someone who had never seen numbers before?</b></p>
  <p>You could explain a number number system to someone who had never seen numbers by showing them a pattern seen when following values within that number system.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="wave" id = "u1l4">
  <h1> Lesson #4 Binary Numbers C.F.U</h1>
  <p><b>Two schools are merging and to adapt to the increased size of the student body, the school is changing its system for keeping track of all student IDs from a system that uses 4-bit binary numbers to one that uses 8-bit binary numbers (AKA 1 byte). Which of the following best describes what effect this change will have?</b></p>
  <p>The 8-bit system will be able to represent sixteen times as many values as the 4-bit system.</p>
  <p><b>Each time we add another bit, what happens to the amount of numbers we can make?</b></p>
  <p>Each time you add another bit, you double the amount of different numbers you can make.</p>
  <p><b>How many bits would be needed to count all of the students in class today?</b></p>
  <p>5 bits because 4 bits is 16 numbers and 5 bits is 32.</p>
  <p><b>What are the similarities and differences between the binary and decimal systems?</b></p>
  <p>The decimal number system includes digits from 0-9 inclusive. In the binary number system, indicated by "bi", theres only two digits which are 0 and 1. One similarity between the decimal and binary number system is that both include 0 and 1.</p>

  <h1> Lesson #5 Overflow and Rounding C.F.U</h1>
  <p><b>Modern car odometers can record up to a million miles driven. What happens to the odometer reading when a car drives beyond its maximum reading?</b></p>
  <p>When a car drives beyond its maximum reading, the odometer resets.</p>
  <p><b>When using bits to represent fractions of a number, can you create all possible fractions? Why or why not?</b></p>
  <p>You cannot create all possible fractions as some numbers are too large or too small for representation.</p>

  <h1> Lesson #7 Black and White Images C.F.U</h1>
  <p><b>Assume your friend just sent you 32 bits of pixel data (just the 0s and 1s for black and white pixels) that were encoded after sampling an image. Choose the two statements that are true.</b></p>
  <p>"The correct width and height must be input into the pixelation widget to produce the image." and "The fact that only 32 bits were used to represent the image indicates relatively large sample squares were used. The digital image may vary from the analog image significantly."</p>
  <p><b>Your computer science teacher asks you to sample a black and white image that is 4" x 6". How would you sample the image to provide a good digital approximation using the pixelation widget? What sample size would you use? How would your decision affect the digital representation?</b></p>
  <p>I would break mine to 24 squares at first then break those squares to even smaller squares. If you sample 90% of the colors in the picture, you will have a detailed representation however it would use more data. Less sampling means low quality but it maintains a small size.</p>

  <div class="wave" id = "u1l8">
  <h1> Lesson #8 Color Images C.F.U</h1>
  <p><b>Which statement about analog and digital images is true?</b></p>
  <p>Sampling an analog image more frequently produces a digital image with a better representation.</p>
  <p><b>Describe how the process of sampling, RGB pixels, and binary sequences work together to display a digital color image.</b></p>
  <p>Binary sequences, RBG pixels, and sampling all work together to display a digital color image by telling the computer where to put RBG pixels and how much opacity to apply to them. It is the culmination of these elements that produces a digital color image.</p>

  <h1> Lesson #9 Lossless Compression C.F.U</h1>
  <p><b>What is the most important quality of lossless compression?</b></p>
  <p>The data is transformed to usually make it smaller. It can always be re-constructed back to the original.</p>
  <p><b>An author is preparing to send their book to a publisher as an email attachment. The file on their computer is 1000 bytes. When they attach the file to their email, it shows as 750 bytes. The author gets very upset because they are concerned that part of their book has been deleted by the email provider.

  If you could talk to this author, how would you explain what is happening to their book?</b></p>
  <p>I would explain to the author that his book is being compressed in a way that he does not lose any work. How this works is that symbols are used for replacing repeating words/phrases to shorten the amount of characters used and the file size.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="wave" id = "u1l10">
  <h1> Lesson #10 Lossy Compression C.F.U</h1>
  <p><b>Youâ€™ve been given a new cell phone with a 2 gigabyte data plan. You plan to use your phone for text messages, images, video, and music. Which of these categories are best compressed using lossless compression? Which of these categories are best compressed using lossy compression? Why?</b></p>
  <p>Text messages and music might best be compressed using lossless compression because repeating elements in these things are compressed into symbols.</p>

  <h1> Lesson #11 Intellectual Property C.F.U</h1>
  <p><b>How is a Creative Commons license different from a regular copyright?</b></p>
  <p>It allows your work to be shared, reused, and remixed to help spark more creativity.</p>
  <p><b>Now that we understand Copyright, what would need to change in order for the scenario from the warm-up to be okay?</b></p>
  <p>I would have to make a creative commons license that lets others use my work and sell items with my work on them.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="wave" id = "u1l12">
  <h1> Lesson #12 Project Digital Information Dilemmas C.F.U</h1>
    <p><b>Many museums have digital catalogs of their collections. What are the potential benefits and harms of creating these digital catalogs?</b></p>
    <p>The fact that digital catalogs are easily accessed, viewable from almost anywhere, and frequently updated are some of their possible advantages. A digital catalog's biggest drawback is its lack of security.</p>
  <p><b>Why should we care about information being represented digitally? How does this impact you personally?</b></p>
  <p>Digital information representation is important because it allows for the storage of large amounts of data in databases, which, depending on their application, can have a variety of advantages. This directly affects me since, like many others, I enter personal information that I want to keep private. We do not want our information to be utilized by hackers or anybody else.</p>
