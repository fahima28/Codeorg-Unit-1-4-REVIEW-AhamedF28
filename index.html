    <b>Unit 1</b>
    <hr>
    <p>Unit 1 was the introduction to coding and web design. We learned basic vocabulary and HTML. Some things we learned were different tags. The tag to start a list is o” for an ordered list and u” for a bulleted list. Each point on the list you have to use li tags. The img tag inserts an image and an attribute for it is src for the source or alt for alternative text. table creates a tag. p is used to insert a paragraph, h1 is the first heading and h2 is the second heading. You can keep increasing the number, the first heading is generally the most important heading. Usually tags start with “<>” with a word in between but the ending tag is usually “</>” with a word between them to show what type of tag it is. We also learned about the different image formats and file extensions: .apng, .gif, .ico, .cur, .jpg, .jpeg, .jfif, .pjpeg, .pjp, .png .svg. In this unit, we acknowledged the importance of making sure an image has a creative commons license, and how to source them if needed. Lossless compression is a process that is generally used for text and as the name suggests, during this process you do not lose information. Lossy compression loses data and it is not reversible. An example of lossy compression is scaling down the resolution of an image, lowering the amount of pixels displayed. Both methods of compression save storage space. Analog data is specific data that is endless while digital data is not as concise and changes discreetly through a finite set of possible values.</p>

    <b>Unit 2</b>
    <hr>
    <p> The focus of unit 2 was to understand how the internet works and its functions. Data packets are sent from one device to another via the internet. These packets are divided into smaller units known as bits, which are subsequently sent via radio waves, wires, and cables in a network. At the receiving device, the packets are put back together. A packet is a chunk of data sent over a network and they may arrive in order, out of order, or not at all. Packet metadata is used to help route packets and reassemble the original message. The router is crucial to how an internet works, it is a type of computer that forwards data across a network. Redundancy is used so if certain components fail, having more than one path between two connected devices ensures that the network keeps working.</p>

    <b>Unit 3</b>
    <hr>
    <p> Unit 3 was centered around the creation of apps and understanding how apps work. Three important vocabulary words we learned in this unit were user interface, input, and output. The input is what the user clicks, presses, or enters. The output is the result of the input. All outputs need inputs. The user interface is what the user needs to interact with the computer. For example, part of a UI can be buttons so when the user clicks a button on the screen, an input occurs and as a result the user gets an input. Furthermore, we learned how to debug and the steps to do so. You have to describe the problem, hunt for bugs, try solutions, and document as you go.

    <b>Unit 4</b>
    <hr>
    <p> In unit 4 I learned about strings, conditionals, boolean expressions, logical operators, and functions. A string is a data type used to represent text instead of numbers and it is usually written inside of quotes. A conditional statement is a statement that needs to meet certain conditions set in order to run. Furthermore, we learned boolean expressions have two results, either true or false. The logical operators we use are “and (&&)”, “equal (==)”, “not equal (!=)”, “less than or equal to (<=)”, and greater than or equal to “>=”. We also learned to use functions to save effort when coding so instead of having to repeat our code, we just run the function again. Functions are modules of code used to complete a specific task.</p>
