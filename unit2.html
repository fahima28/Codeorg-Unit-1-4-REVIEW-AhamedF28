  <h1> Lesson #1 Welcome to the Internet C.F.U</h1>
  <p><b>How do you use the Internet?

  Think about your typical day. When are you using the Internet? For what purposes? What role does it have in your life?</b></p>
  <p>I use the internet to do my homework and submit work online. I watch  YouTube and play online video games for entertainment. Moreover I use it to talk and communicate with my friends online. I believe the internet plays a very significant part of my life.</p>

  <h1> Lesson #2 Building a Network C.F.U</h1>
  <p><b>Describe two different paths that a message could take from Person A to Person D.</b></p>
  <p>A to B to D or A to E to C to D</p>
  </div>
  <hr>
  <div class="wave" id = "u2l3">
  <h1> Lesson #3 The Need for Addressing C.F.U</h1>
  <p><b>Pick the two statements that are true about the Internet Protocol (IP):</b></p>
  <p>"A.   Each device or computer on the Internet is assigned a unique IP address." and "E.   IP is the shared way that all devices and computers label their messages with the sender and receiver's addresses."</p>
  <p><b>Describe how the Internet Protocol (IP) allows devices to easily connect and communicate on the Internet.</b></p>
  <p>By enabling messages to have a clear sender and destination that permits proper information to be transferred to the proper destinations, the Internet Protocol makes it simple for devices to connect and communicate over the internet.</p>

  <h1> Lesson #4 Routers and Redundancy C.F.U</h1>
  <p><b>Pick Two: If the post office delivered mail exactly like the routers deliver messages on the Internet, which of the following statements would be true?</b></p>
  <p>"B.   The mailman would sometimes take a different path to deliver each letter to your home" and "C.   Letters would be written on the outside of the envelope for all to read instead of letters put inside envelopes"</p>
  <p><b>What are the benefits of building redundancy into a network? What are the potential issues with building redundancy?</b></p>
  <p>By incorporating redundancy, a network can withstand faults. Information can still find its way to its intended receiver even if individual components malfunction. Redundancy can be an issue if information takes long and inefficient paths to reach their destination.</p>

  <div class="wave" id = "u2l5">
  <h1> Lesson #5 Packets C.F.U</h1>
  <p><b>Which of the following is true regarding the way information is transmitted on the Internet?</b></p>
  <p>D.   Information does not travel in one piece, but rather as a datastream of packets.</p>
  <p><b>Terminology Matching
</b></p>
  <p>Internet Protocol (IP): Rules for addressing and sending data across the internet by assigning unique numbers to each connected device
  <br>
  <br>
  Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): Takes inventory of all packets in the datastream to ensure they are successfully sent and received.
  <br>
  <br>
  Packet: Chunk of data and its metadata, used to route and reassemble information on the Internet.
  <br>
  <br>
  Datastream: The way in which information travels on the Internet, not as a single piece but in chunks.
  <br>
  <br>
  User Datagram Protocol (UDP): Sends all packets without checking whether they were received or ordered properly

  <h1> Lesson #6 HTTP and DNS C.F.U</h1>
  <p><b>In your own words explain the following about the Domain Name System

  What problem does the DNS solve?
  How does the DNS help the world wide web scale so that billions of users can access billions of web pages?</b></p>
  <p>By converting an English-written website into an IP address, it enables users to be redirected to websites where they are trying to see content. In order to deliver information to consumers worldwide, it creates a more structured system that can translate human language into computer language and then communicate this language among other computers.
</p>
  <p><b>Choose the two statements that best describe the relationship between HTTP and the World Wide Web</b></p>
  <p>"B.   The World Wide Web is a collection of pages and files that is shared between computers using HTTP" and "D.   HTTP and the World Wide Web both rely on other layers of protocols for sending information on the Internet"</p>
